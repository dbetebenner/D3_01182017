New Year's Resolution for 2017: Make a D3 Block a day to teach myself D3. This is Number 18. This example
builds on yesterday's [USA district map](https://github.com/dbetebenner/D3_01172017) adding in the layer showing
state boundaries so that the map has better legibility. The visualization shows Alaska and Hawaii in the lower left
using D3's [geoAlbersUsa](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoAlbersUsa) projection.
The topoJSON files used to construct this visualization were created by me using
[shape files](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/geographicDistrictBoundary.aspx) compiled by the NCES and the United States Census Bureau.
[The Center for Assessment](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment) makes these
[state and national school district topoJSON files](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGPspatialData) available
for anyone to use in their own development.
